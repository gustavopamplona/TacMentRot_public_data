How to run the presentation code:

- Change the folder for the wave files in "wavfilename" in line 5 from "playsound.m"
- Change the folder for the figures in "folder" in line 20 from "TactileHandsRotation.m"
- Change the number of trials in line 23 from "TactileHandsRotation.m"
- Run the script "TactileHandsRotation.m"
- Insert participant code and run
- Trigger is represented by the "s" key of the keyboard (the code needs a repeated trigger signal to work)

- "quasirandom.m" randomizes the stimuli, but doesn't allow for 2 of the same modality (haptic, visual) in a row
- "playsound.m" plays the stimulus codes for the haptic stimuli to be presented by an experimenter in the scanner room
